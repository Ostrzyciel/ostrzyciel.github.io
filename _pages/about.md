Hi! I'm Piotr, co-founder and CTO of **[NeverBlink](https://neverblink.eu)**, where we build next-generation knowledge graph and neurosymbolic systems. We've created [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly/), a super-efficient RDF knowledge graph streaming protocol, with implementations for [Apache Jena, RDF4J](https://w3id.org/jelly/jelly-jvm) and [rdflib](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly). Check out the **[projects section](/projects/)** or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Ostrzyciel), maybe you will find something useful there.

I'm also finishing my PhD at the Warsaw University of Technology, advised by [Maria Ganzha](https://pages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~ganzham/www/). In 2024 I did a research visit at TU Berlin's [PICOM lab](https://picom.ai/), under the supervision of [Danh Le Phuoc](https://danhlephuoc.info/). You can find out more about my research in the [publications section](/publications/).

Currently my R&D focus is on making knowledge graph (RDF) streaming systems more efficient and practical, which also happens to be the mission of [NeverBlink](https://neverblink.eu). This includes: the [RDF Stream Taxonomy](https://w3id.org/stax/), [RiverBench](https://w3id.org/riverbench/) -- an open RDF streaming benchmark suite, and of course [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly/).

Oh, and do check out my **[blog](/blog/)**, where I write about research, programming (Python, Scala...), technology, and a few other things.
