Hi! I'm Piotr, co-founder of **[NeverBlink](https://neverblink.eu)**, where we build next-generation knowledge graph systems. I'm also finishing my PhD at the Warsaw University of Technology, advised by [Maria Ganzha](https://pages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~ganzham/www/). In 2024 I did a research visit at TU Berlin's [PICOM lab](https://picom.ai/), under the supervision of [Danh Le Phuoc](https://danhlephuoc.info/). My work is mostly around the topics of knowledge graphs, streaming, Cloud-Edge-IoT systems, and machine learning. You can find out more about my research in the [publications](/publications/) section.

I'm a strong supporter of open science and open source software, so I try to publish everything I can under free licenses. Check out the [projects](/projects/) section or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Ostrzyciel), maybe you will find something useful there.

Most recently my focus is on making knowledge graph (RDF) streaming systems more efficient and practical. My work includes: the [RDF Stream Taxonomy](https://w3id.org/stax/), [RiverBench](https://w3id.org/riverbench/) -- an open RDF streaming benchmark suite, and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly/) -- a super-efficient RDF streaming protocol with implementations for Apache Jena and RDF4J.

Oh, and do check out my **[blog](/blog/)**, where I write about research, programming (Python, Scala...), technology, and a few other things.
